<h1>A List of Movies that I like</h1>
<h2>In no particular order, here are some movies I've enjoyed watching at the top of my head</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Smokin' Aces (2006)</h3>
<p>This is the first movie that popped into my head to make this list. It's a movie I've watched before and
    have been recently craving to want to watch it again. This 2006 movie features a grand cast of individuals
    telling a story of how one man's ego got himself in hot water with the mafia who hired a mob of eclectic assassins
    to make sure he doesn't leave his suite alive.

<h3>Be Kind Rewind (2008)</h3>
<p>This was the second movie to pop into my head for this list. It's a heartwwarming tale of friendship, creativity
and belonging to a community. Jack Black and Mos Def are a great comedy duo and Danny Glover as the video store clerk.

<h3>The Florida Project (2017)</h3>
<p>This third entry took some time to think of that was worthy enough for this list. John Wick and Terrifier were the honourable
    mentions that didn't make the cut. I really love this movie and  find myself rewatching it every once in a while.

<h3>Blues Brothers 2000 (1998)</h3>
<p>This is the last movie on this list and is probably the reason why I listed the movies like I did. I rented
    this movie when I was a young child living in Scarborough and thought the dealership in the movie looked familliar
    Turns out a lot of this movie was filmed in Toronto.
